# SimplePHPCheckbook
 Basic check register using PostgreSQL; proof-of-concept, not secure
 
 This is remedial software demonstrating a web-based checkbook using PHP and PL/pgSQL. It's not intended for production use.
 
 Anyone may (try to) use it, anyone may copy and/or redistribute it in part or in full.
 
 But if your microwave oven melts, don't come crying to me.
